# Inventory_Management
 It is a Daa project to manage an inventory and I am going to keep a comparison scale to choose the packets that would bring maximum profit. This is made using a Fractional Knapsack.
you do have to log in before having an inventory or editing an inventory.
You need to add a product and edit it accordingly if needed.
